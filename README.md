## Word Search Solver
Receives a crossword puzzle in the form of a one-dimensional array of strings and then launches a GUI allowing the user to enter a word or phrase to find. The words and phrases can be located backwards and forwards in the puzzle's rows, columns, and diagonals.

### Next Steps
* Currently, puzzles must be manually entered letter by letter.  I hope to read about computer vision and available PDF-editing tools in order to generate puzzles based on scanned pages.
* Offer users the choice of one or more highlight colors.
* Bind "Enter"/"Return" key to button for ease of use.
